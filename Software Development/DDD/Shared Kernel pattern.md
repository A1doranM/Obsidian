The Shared Kernel Pattern describes a common core that is shared by multiple bounded contexts.

The data of a customer is an example of such a scenario.

However, the _shared kernel_ comprises shared business logic and shared database schema and therefore **should not be used in a microservices environment**.

It is an anti-pattern for microservices systems. But because DDD can also be applied to deployment monoliths, there are still scenarios in which a shared kernel makes sense.
